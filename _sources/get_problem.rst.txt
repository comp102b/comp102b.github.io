Starting an assignment
=======================

After the assignments are announced in class, they can be started in the
system. Let us see how to do that. First, using our handy **comp102b** tool,
let us view the assignments :

::

 comp102b assignments

This will list you the available assignments, their due dates and points associated
with it. Now type the following to start an assignment :

::

 comp102b start

You will be prompted to enter the assignment name. Enter the name of the assignment you want to
start working on and press enter.

Voila! The scaffolding has been made for you! In your project explorer you
will see a directory with the problem name. (Given that you ran the above command within /projects/ directory)
