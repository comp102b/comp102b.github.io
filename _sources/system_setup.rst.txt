Setting up your system
========================

If you are having trouble accessing Codenvy for your assignments, you can also
manually set up your laptop / home computer with the tools required. All you need is
to follow the steps with respect to your own operating system :

Mac
----------

- Download `this script <uploads/setup_mac.sh>`_. Open your Terminal and navigate to the Downloads directory and run the script :

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Downloads
    sh setup_mac.sh

- This will install the Comp102B script in your system. Check whether it is installed by typing this command :

  .. code-block:: bash

    comp102b --help

Ubuntu
-----------

- Download `this script <uploads/setup.sh>`_. Open your Terminal and navigate to the directory where it has downloaded (if in "Downloads") and run the script :

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Downloads
    sh setup.sh

- This will install the Comp102B script in your system. Check whether it is installed by typing this command :

  .. code-block:: bash

    comp102b --help


Windows
---------

- Unfortunately we do not support Windows at this moment. Please try it on `Codenvy <https://codenvy.io/>`_ or in Trottier Lab computers (Ubuntu).
