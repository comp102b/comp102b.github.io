Submitting your Assignment
==========================

To submit the assignment, first navigate to the folder in which the problem lies.
Your prompt should display the current folder as the problem name. For example,
if you have started *problem-001*, then you must *cd* into this directory like this :

::

 :projects/$ cd problem-001
 :projects/problem-001/$

Notice the change in prompt. Now you can submit your assignment using this command :

::

 comp102b submit

And then your submission will be submitted to our servers.
