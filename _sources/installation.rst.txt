Getting Started
===================

Script Installation
-------------------

Within your `Codenvy <https://codenvy.io/>`_ platform, open a 'Terminal' and run the following
command. This will download a pre-built script to help your installation.

::

 git clone http://drgitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/comp102b/setup.git

Now navigate into the directory :

::

 cd setup

Then run the script. This script will install Python 2.7 in the Codenvy system
and install the **comp102b** tool.

::

 sh setup.sh

Now you need to setup your terminal for the environment variables. Type this from the
terminal :

::

 source ~/.bashrc

Your system is now ready for assignments.

Manual Installation
--------------------

This assumes you already have Python 2.7 installed. On your `Codenvy <https://codenvy.io/>`_ platform, open a 'Terminal' and run the following
piece of code to download the file :

::

 curl -O -J http://132.206.3.23:8056/uploads/comp102b-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl

The binary is now downloaded in the file *comp.whl* . Install that file using the
following command :

::

 pip install comp102b-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl

This installs a command line tool, **comp102b**, using which we will start and
submit all assignments. But first, you need to log in!

Logging you in
----------------

You should be provided an unique username / password combination by the TA's. If not,
just drop by a mail to TA's to get them.

Once you have your username and password, log in the system using this command :

::

 comp102b login

The system will prompt you for username and password. Remember, this is an Unix
system so you would not *see* your password getting typed. Once done, press enter
and you should be logged in.

Now check whether you have been successfully logged in :

::

 comp102b whoami

You should be able to see your name and email address.
