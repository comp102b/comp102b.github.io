Running your solution
=====================

You can always run the solution locally (using `python <filename>` or `sh <filename>`),
however we have also included a functionality within the **comp102b** system for
you to run. To run your solution, type in the following :

::

 comp102b run

This will now run the solution from `main.py`. Points to note that you should
not alter `main.py` or wherever directed in order for your submission to run on
our servers.
