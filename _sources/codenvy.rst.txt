Working on Codenvy
======================

For the purposes of this course, we will use a web based software `Codenvy <https://codenvy.io/>`. Codenvy creates virtual machines
in Ubuntu Linux for you to use, and it also provides a nice IDE for code development. In this tutorial, we will show you how to
setup your Codenvy platform.

1. Navigate to `Codenvy <https://codenvy.io/>` website
2. Create a new account or log in with your existing account.
3. Once you log in, you will be presented with a page to create a **Workspace** :

4. Select Source -> New from blank template, sample or project
5. Select Stack -> Create new workspace from stack
6. Under the tab "Ready-to-go stacks", scroll down and select the one named "**Python**"
7. Select RAM to be 2 GB. You can at maximum select it to be 3GB.
8. Leave other descriptions as it is, click on **Create**.

Now you wait for a moment for Codenvy to set your IDE up.

**Pro Tip** : If it takes too much time to set up, consider updating your browser or use
a latest Chrome Browser

Once it loads, you should see a screen like this :

On your left you will see the file browser, from where you can select any file
and edit here. Hooray! You have setup the Codenvy platform! Now head over to Getting Started
to setup our submission tool.
